## Notes
- The RAG system requires Azure credentials to function
- If Azure credentials are not provided, the RAG system will show an error message
- The ATS system works independently and doesn't require external services
- Both systems are integrated with the existing authentication system

## Troubleshooting
- If you see "RAG system not initialized" errors, check your Azure credentials
- For ATS issues, ensure uploaded files are valid PDFs
- Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
